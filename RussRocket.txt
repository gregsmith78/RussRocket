A Russian rocket just 
recently launched 
into space
carrying a 
three-man crew.  
Part of that 
crew was 
Britain's first
official 
astronaut, Tim Peake.  
The rocket carryin
the Soyuz 
TMA-19M spaceship lifted 
off at 1703 pm local 
time and successfully 
reached its designated  
orbit about nine minutes later.  
As well as Peake, the crew 
commander Yuri Malenchenko, 
a former Russian Air Force 
pilot and veteran of long-duration 
space flights, and NASA
astronaut Tim Kopra.  

Peake, 43
a former army
major who is
in his
six-month
mission for 
the European 
Space Agency (ESA) 
became the first 
Briton to go into 
space since Helen 
Sharman traveled 
on Soviet spacecraft 
for eight days in 1991.
City officials and schools 
in Baltimore, a city hit by 
rioting earlier this year, 
braced for the possibility of 
more violent protests as a jury 
on Tuesday deliberated the case 
of a police officer charged in 
the death of a black detainee.

Officer William Porter, 26, is on trial for manslaughter and other charges in Freddie Gray's death from a broken neck suffered in the back of a police van. Gray's death in April triggered protests and rioting and intensified a U.S. debate on police treatment of minorities.

Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was opening an emergency operations center and pleaded for calm.
